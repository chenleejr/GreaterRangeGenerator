CustomizableGenerator

[h1] Function [/h1]
Support sandbox configuration, applied to all generators.

[list]
    [*]Radius, 1-60, the original version is 20.
    [*]Floor distance, 0-8, the original version is 3, 0 means it only takes effect on the current floor. Explanation: For example, if the ground or first floor is level=0, in the original version, if the generator was placed on the 5th floor (level=4), then the range is from the 2nd floor (level=1) to the 8th floor (level=7), and there is no electricity on the ground.
    [*]Max fuel amount, 10-400, the original version is 100. You can see the current fuel amount on the generator information panel, for example, set the max fuel amount to 200, and it will display 200% after full fuel.
    [*]Considering for realism, the setting is not allowed to be too large. In the future, generators with large settings will be supported in other ways.

[h1] Compatibility with other mods [/h1]
[list]
[*] Some other generator-like item mods, such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2762648316]Steam Powered Generator[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857548524]Immersive Solar Arrays (v41, GitHub reupload)[/url], because the these 2 mods also utilize the system's generator, their range will also be affected.
[*] Some other display generator information mods, such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972289937]Visible Generator Range[/url], since the generator related parameters are hardcoded in this mod, the displaying info maybe different from the actual effect.
