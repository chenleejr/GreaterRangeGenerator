[h1] Function [/h1]
Enable all generators to have a larger power generation range.

[list]
[*] Radius 20->40
[*] Floor distance 3->5. Explanation: For example, if the ground or first floor is level=0, in the original version, if the generator was placed on the 5th floor (level=4), then the range is from the 2nd floor (level=1) to the 8th floor (level=7), and there is no electricity on the ground. After installing this mod, there will be electricity on the ground.

[list]
[*] Some other generator-like item mods, such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2762648316]Steam Powered Generator[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857548524]Immersive Solar Arrays (v41, GitHub reupload)[/url], because the these 2 mods also utilize the system's generator, their range will also be affected.
[*] Some other display generator information mods, such as [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972289937]Visible Generator Range[/url], since the generator related parameters are hardcoded in this mod, the displaying info maybe different from the actual effect.
